00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.566
Hello, welcome to the overview of Ask Data for a technical audience.
This video has been created for

2
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:16.132
anyone needing to understand Ask Data from a technical perspective.
So, for this section, we will look at how

3
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:23.033
Ask Data functions at a high level - before diving into a description of the underlying process architecture.

4
00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:29.566
We’ll also look at some resources that can help customers obtain the best results when using Ask Data.

5
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:40.899
The Ask Data feature was introduced in Tableau 2019.1, with major enhancements to Ask Data subsequently delivered in 2021.2.

6
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.133
Ask Data allows customers to use natural language
to ask questions and produce insights directly

7
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.366
from any data source
published on Tableau Server or Tableau Online.

8
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:58.799
Ask Data enables customers to type a question into a text box
using natural language

9
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.233
and Tableau will produce an answer in the form of a Viz.

10
00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:11.366
Ask Data supports many of the analytical capabilities of Tableau, including grouping, sorting, filtering and aggregations.

11
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:17.166
If you would like an excellent introduction and overview of Ask Data,

12
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:23.566
you can view the presentation delivered by Product Manager
Jared Briskman at Tableau Conference 2021,

13
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.566
which is linked in this course.

14
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:35.932
Lenses are a new content type, like a published workbook or Prep flow, specifically for Ask Data,

15
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:39.499
and are required for versions 2021.2 and on.

16
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.766
Lenses are created on top of published data sources, and allow for the curation and governance

17
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:50.666
of Ask Data use cases, while maintaining the source of truth of the data source.

18
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:59.166
A published data source can have no lenses (which is the default), a single lens, or multiple lenses.

19
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:08.532
Lenses allow for the curation of Ask Data, and introduce the ability to select which fields are available for the Ask Data user.

20
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:17.199
Lenses must be authored by Explorer or Creator licensed users, but are accessible by viewers.

21
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.033
The bottom line of this is that: no lens means no Ask Data access.

22
00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:31.133
Let’s take a look at what’s needed to interact with Ask Data on Tableau Server or Tableau Online.

23
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:36.466
Ask Data requires a published data source, and to use Ask Data,

24
00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:40.732
users must have permission to connect to the underlying data source.

25
00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:48.866
One thing to keep in mind is that If a data source has row-level permissions,
those permissions also apply to Ask Data,

26
00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:54.532
which won’t recognize secure values or make related statistical recommendations.

27
00:02:54.533 --> 00:03:05.966
Now, starting with version 2021.2, a Creator or Explorer must first author a “Lens” to access a published datasource using Ask Data.

28
00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:13.399
A Lens should include fields relevant to a specific use case identified by the Lens Author.

29
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.466
Lens authors can create “synonyms” for fields to help business users ask questions using natural language.

30
00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:26.099
An example of a “synonym” might be to add the words “best” “best performing”
or “top”

31
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.566
to represent the TOP 5 results from a dataset.

32
00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:37.932
Ask Data is tightly integrated with several services, but it relies especially on two:

33
00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:43.366
Natural Language Processing, or NLP, as well as Elastic Server.

34
00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:53.199
Here’s an example of how Ask Data and Elastic Server appear in the TSM Web UI and in the TSM CLI.

35
00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:05.366
The Ask Data feature relies on several Tableau services working together, which you
can see here.

36
00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:11.599
These include Data Server, as well as VizQL Server,
Columbo, which is a part of TabAdmin agent

37
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:20.766
which helps microservices find things, NLP,
Elastic Server, and Content Model Microservice, or CMM for short.

38
00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:25.766
By default, the Ask Data processes install to node 1.

39
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:32.632
The Ask Data service can not be configured manually
and will run automatically on any node running

40
00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:34.399
Data Server.

41
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.966
Now, we're going to take a look at the Tableau services which Ask Data relies on.

42
00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:47.166
Ask Data is Natural Language Processing, which is abbreviated NLP.

43
00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:54.966
This is a translation layer that helps the user submit a query into Vizql without dragging and dropping.

44
00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:59.532
Ask Data is tightly integrated with Vizql and DataServer.

45
00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:04.399
It gets information from both Elastic Server and Content Model Microservice (CMM),

46
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.166
but Elastic Server and CMM do not coordinate with each other directly, which we'll cover a little bit later.

47
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:20.832
Ask Data logs natural language queries issued by users in log files for the NLP service, which is managed by TSM.

48
00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:26.566
Next up, let's take a look at Elastic Server.

49
00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:34.166
Elastic Server is a wrapper process for elastic search, which is a standard, open source search engine, like SOLR.

50
00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:39.766
Elasticsearch is the process that helps Ask Data "learn" the data source,

51
00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:45.666
by collecting the fields
and values contained in the data to create more responsive search results.

52
00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:55.832
TSM manages starting, running and serving elasticsearch through Elastic Server, and the data is stored on Elastic Server.

53
00:05:55.833 --> 00:06:03.766
When a datasource has changed or been added,
Elastic Server is notified to relearn the data source.

54
00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:12.566
Now in this context, learning the data source
means to profile the data to leverage statistics about the range and distribution of the data.

55
00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:17.599
This also pulls out categories from dimensions and summarizes measures.

56
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:25.800
The Elastic Server’s role of learning the contents of a published data source is essential for the processing of Ask Data.

57
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.100
The logs of elastic search are in the
logs/elasticsearch directory.

58
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:40.000
There are elastic specific logs, and stdout logs that only show the startup part of the logs.

59
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.466
Now let’s take a look at Content Model Microservice, or CMM.
CMM is deployed inside the Interactive

60
00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:51.299
Microservice Container.

61
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.233
This service is responsible for providing the list of fields
and associated metadata

62
00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:04.699
from a Tableau Data Source, such as the field’s data type, aggregation type,
calculation formulas,

63
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:12.100
remote columns, whether it's in a folder or hierarchy, all of which is written to PostgresQL.

64
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:20.600
If you see any problems with this service, you should check the Interactive Microservice Logs folder for more information.

65
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.766
Now, the Interactive Microservices Container is not configurable and is deployed on nodes that have vizportal.

66
00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:33.366
Now let's look at Navigating logs for Ask Data.

67
00:07:33.366 --> 00:07:40.232
Ask Data adds an additional layer of processing to the existing Vizql and Data Server
Processes

68
00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.199
that are used to build a viz on Tableau Server.

69
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.800
An Ask Data query traverses multiple log
files as it is fulfilled,

70
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.666
including the Gateway, VizPortal, Data Server, and VizQLServer.

71
00:07:53.666 --> 00:08:00.299
The NLP log corresponds to the Ask Data process in TSM.

72
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.666
When the NLP (or Ask Data) service starts,
it will print the text “A natural language service”,

73
00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:10.866
which is shown highlighted in orange here on the screen.

74
00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:19.366
If the phrase "A natural language service" appears more than once in the logs, it means that the Ask Data service was restarted.

75
00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:27.599
Once all the Ask Data services are active, the logs print the phrase “GRPC server listening on port”

76
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.500
- this indicates that the NLP is on and running.

77
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:42.300
One key you'll need to trace these logs is to know that the ID in the stdout_nlp logs will lead you to the UUID

78
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.233
in the nativeapi_vizqlserver logs.

79
00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:55.099
When working a support case for Ask Data,
try to identify the correct User ID (nuser_action-id).

80
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.666
from the stdout_nlp log.

81
00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:04.132
You should also use timestamps to make sure you are tracking the right requests.

82
00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:08.599
Now, I know that was a lot of information in a short amount of time,

83
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.266
so let’s summarize a few of the key takeaways for Troubleshooting Ask Data:

84
00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:19.866
We need to ensure that all of the necessary processes are running on Tableau Server.

85
00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:25.166
We can ask the questions: Has Ask Data been enabled at the Server/Site-Level?

86
00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:29.932
Does the user have permission to the underlying published data source?

87
00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:35.199
Has a Lens been created for the published data source the customer wants to access?

88
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.866
Does the customer have the appropriate permissions to access the published data source?

89
00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:47.399
If a customer is having trouble authoring a Lens, are they an Explorer or Creator?

90
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:54.466
You can also Trace a user request using a timestamp, ID and UUID

91
00:09:54.466 --> 00:10:00.932
in the stdout_nlp and nativeapi_vizqlserver logs

92
00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:10.733
If you run into additional issues with Ask Data, you can reach out to the dev team for help on slack in #ask-data-help.

93
00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:17.599
Now keep in mind that Ask Data can not be manually configured,

94
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.000
however, Tableau does provide recommendations to ensure that customers get the best results.

95
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.566
For improved performance and support for large data sets, customers should use Ask Data with published extracts rather than live data sources.

96
00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:37.799
A Lens should only include fields relevant to a specific business use case.

97
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.400
Lens Authors should engage business users to discover which Lenses they need:

98
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.966
They should see, What questions do business people ask?

99
00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:49.566
What do they need to know?

100
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:54.566
For additional tips on how customers can get the best results from Ask Data,

101
00:10:54.566 --> 00:11:02.266
review the Online Help page titled “Optimize Data for Ask Data”, which is also linked in this training.

102
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:08.366
Thank you very much for your time, this has been an overview of Ask Data for a technical audience.
