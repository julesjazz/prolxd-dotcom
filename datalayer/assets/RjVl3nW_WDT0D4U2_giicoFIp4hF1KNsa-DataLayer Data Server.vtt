Hello and Welcome to the Overview of Data Server.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.333
We have 3 goals for this section: we're going to define and identify Data Server functionality,

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:23.066
Identify how to determine a data source for a .twb workbook, and locate the logs generated by the Data Server process.

5
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:28.332
Now in this section, we're going to take a deeper look into Data Server.

6
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:35.866
Data Server allows users to have a single source for their data, helping to cut down on duplicate data when using Tableau

7
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:41.366
Visualizations, by publishing data sources to one central location.

8
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:48.799
and you can see here on the screen a little bit about how data server interacts.

9
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.833
So let's take a look at what data server is involved in.

10
00:00:52.833 --> 00:01:00.999
Data Server handles published data sources. You can see that's bolded and highlighted here because that is its functionality.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.300
Data server is not involved if the data source is embedded, whether it’s a live data source, extracted

12
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.633
a flat file, or relational database.  It only gets involved if it’s a published data source.

13
00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:20.733
A couple things to note about Data Server: it allows sharing of metadata,

14
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.199
and provides indirect deduplication of data.

15
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.733
Additionally, Data Server is accessed via HTTP.

16
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.466
Now, because Data Server is contacted over HTTP,

17
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:37.866
it can be vulnerable to misconfigured forward proxies in the customer environment.

18
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:46.299
The documentation on configuring a forward proxy server is largely there to help Data Server run smoothly.

19
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.566
Now, let's take a look at the connection information we can find for Data Server.

20
00:01:51.566 --> 00:02:01.932
now one thing to keep in mind is .twb file workbooks are just XML files, so you can view them in any text editor.

21
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:09.633
So first this workbook that we're looking athas an embedded Data Source.  You can see the information highlighted here

22
00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:14.699
which will allow it to connect to the SQL server clearly.

23
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.600
Now this is a workbook with that embedded data source that is shown here. You can see

24
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:30.533
the highlighted information does show our connection authentication, the class, the DB name and other information that's important.

25
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.799
The second workbook that you see here

26
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.600
is a workbook that connects to a published copy of that same data source.

27
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.433
So while the name of the data source is the same, the server information

28
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:49.666
is for the Tableau server apc.tsi.lan, and the class is SQL proxy.

29
00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:54.332
Nowhere in this workbook will you find details on the Microsoft SQL server

30
00:02:54.333 --> 00:03:00.466
that has the actual data.

31
00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:04.732
For that you will need to look at the data source XML.

32
00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:13.699
You can see the SQL information here. So Data Server is essentially acting as a proxy for published data source requests.

33
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.900
The requesting process will attempt to contact Data Server and since this request is an HTTP call, it has to go through the Gateway process.

34
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.400
Once the request has been routed to Data Server, Data Server will generate the final query and send it on to the right place

35
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.766
either tabprotosrv for contacting external databases or communicating directly with Data Engine.

36
00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.932
contacting external databases or communicating directly with the danger

37
00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:54.799
You can see here in example of what data server request looks like in fiddler trace.

38
00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.100
Now, logs for the data server process are located in different locations for Linux and Windows, as we've discussed in some prior

39
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.966
courses and you can see on the screen here the location for Linux and Windows

40
00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:10.099
This is where you'll be able to find information

41
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.000
on the Data Server process and if there were any issues that took place in those logs
